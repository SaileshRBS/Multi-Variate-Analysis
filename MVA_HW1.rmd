###Taking the sparr data which is in tibble form and converted into a dataframe###

  #Column Means
colMeans(subset(sparr, Survivorship == "NS")[,c("Total_length","Alar_extent","L_beak_head","L_humerous","L_keel_sternum")])

###Using the sparr dataset when applied colmeans to the subset and to the column " Survivorship" , by only considering "NS" type in that column and you can see that the highest means for a partucular column is for "Alar_extent" and least is for " L_humerous"###

  #Correlation

### When correlation is applied to  the dataset by whcih we can observe  which two columns are closely related to eachother. First, we have applied it for 'NS' and the columns mentioned in the dataset.The highest correlation is between " L_beak_head" and " L_humerous" which is 0.83 and the lowest correlation is between "L_ keel_sternum " and "L_beak_head" which is 0.56###
